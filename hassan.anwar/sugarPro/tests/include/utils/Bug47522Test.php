 This unit test simulates cleaning the key values in a POST/REQUEST when mbstring.encoding_translation is on.
 When you turn on  mbstring.encoding_translation in php.ini, it's supposed to translate the characters in the POST array during an http request.
 It's not supposed to touch the key names though.  This test is for the code that cleans those key names
