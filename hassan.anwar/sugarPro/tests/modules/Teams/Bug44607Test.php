/**
 * Bug44607Test
 * 
 * This bug tests the case where a user with a reports to id value that pointed to a user
 * that did not exist in the system or was deleted (record not just deleted flag) would cause
 * the code in Team.php (add_user_to_team) to run in an infinite loop.  Obviously, we do not
 * set the code to run in an infinite loop, but we do test that we get out of it and that no
 * team_membership entries are created for a user that does not exist.
